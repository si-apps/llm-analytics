### Coding style

### Testing

All contributions must be accompanied by tests to ensure that the code works as expected and does not introduce regressions.

#### Running unit tests
To creat a virtual environment, use the following command:
```sh
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade && pip install -r test/test.requirements.txt --upgrade
```

To run all the unit tests locally, use the following command:
```sh
PYTHONPATH=src:test python -m pytest --color=yes test/*_unit.py
```
Unit tests also run automatically on every push using a dedicated workflow.

#### Running integration tests
To run integration tests locally, you first have to add API keys to your environment. You can do it by creating evn files under the config dir: 

aws.env.list
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
AWS_REGION=YOUR_REGION
```
Then, to run all the integration tests locally, use the following command:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src:test python -m pytest --color=yes test/integration_tests.py
```

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src:test python -m pytest --color=yes test/validation_tests.py
```


### Building docker image and using it
To build the docker image, use the following command from the root of the repository:
```sh
docker build -t llm-analytics .
```
To run the docker image, use the following command:
```sh
docker run -it --rm --name llm-analytics -p 5000:5000 si4apps/llm-analytics
```

### Version publication

Before publishing a new version, make sure the main branch is up-to-date, for example push changes from the dev branch to the main branch:
```sh
git switch dev
git pull
git push origin dev:main
```
Monitor the workflow to make sure tests are passing and then move to the version update.

The versions of the projects are managed using git tags. To publish a new version, make sure the main branch is up-to-date and create a new tag with the version number:
```sh
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release 0.1.0"
git push --tags
```
Workflow will automatically publish the new version to the Docker repository under github container registry.

### Issues management

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please create an issue in the GitHub repository. Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and address the issue.

We will review your issue and respond as soon as possible. Thank you for helping us improve the project!
